# 👋 Hey there, fellow Humans!

I'm **Eldarion** — a passionate, self-taught `Fullswag Developer` 👨‍💻 from 🇮🇳 India.

Born on **October 24th**, I live and breathe code, coffee ☕, and creativity. I specialize in building Discord bots, sleek web apps, and dabbling in the world of **cybersecurity**. Whether it’s solo-building something cool or vibing in a community, I’m always up for learning something new.

> **He/Him | Developer. Dreamer. Discord-native.**
